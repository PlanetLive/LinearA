# Linear A+ &ndash; Global Mirror Network Model Building

Understanding early communication using mirrors, drums and fire signals for trade route logistics is an important step toward connecting the threads of world history - specifically megalythic structures, hilltop temples, mound villages and straight roads with cleared forest canopies for line-of-sight communication.

Our current focus is on expanding on the LinearA translations of Hiro Kuroda by adding related information and illustration as we explore theories on how the Minoan mirror communication network fostered trade in the Mediterranean around 1400 BCE, up to the restoration of signal communication with Egypt by Alexander the Great with the guidance of hill temple operators (oracles) in 380 BCE.

Our observation is that Linear A was (1) designed to be concise, using sounds from the start of words, and (2) efficient with minimum strokes like its offspring Katakana. Translations using Japanese seem to reveal that artifacts like the Phaistos Disc seasonal migrations and long distance communication using mirrors for "putting light" across great distances between islands.

The third image above is a dual-mirror for sending Morse Code which was inspired by a theodolite survey crew in India who were returning messages to other crew members.

The box-mirror above was found in Israel in 2023 in the tomb of a woman traveling with Alexander's generals.

## Get Involved!

Contribute updates and images, add your comments as GitHub issues, and reuse our pages as submodules in your projects and models.

You can include as a [submodule within a GitHub site](/localsite/start/submodules). 

	git submodule add https://github.com/PlanetLive/LinearA LinearA
	git commit -m "[repo] submodule"
	git submodule update --init --recursive

Also include the ModelEarth localsite repo as a submodule for common navigation javascript.

	git submodule add https://github.com/ModelEarth/ModelEarth localsite
	git commit -m "[repo] submodule"
	git submodule update --init --recursive

Lastly, push within Github Desktop. (The repos will already be commited.)
Then you'll see the submodules in your main Github website and you can view it at yoursite.github.io/LinearA or your custom domain.

## Dive in, but take your mirrors!

The shape of the Minoan shield is perfect for carrying the two sides of your mirror box - for communicating from boat decks to hill temples. With the strings attached to your metal plates, you have a scale for weighing shipping goods (grains and spices) in the market. When sealed with your front metal plate, the shield becomes a floatation device which holds your paperwork and cipher ax-mirror.

From the side of a small ax-mirror, a handy ciper helps young mirror operators learn to translate the signals that arrive like drum beats - and sometimes are drum beats or even fires burning is signal towers, lighthouses and the tops of pyramids.  Sometimes the fire signals are fueled by naturally seeping hydrogen and methane, like the hydrogen wind that rushes out of a dry well in a Mali village. In 2023, the Mali village converted from buring the hydrogen for power to using a clean fuelcell to power their homes!
