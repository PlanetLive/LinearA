# Linear A Script <!--&ndash; Model Building-->

## Global Mirror Network

Exploring the use of mirrors, drums, fire signals, and bird couriers for trade logistics prior to 1,400 BCE can improve the accuracy of translations and understanding of early art. <!--Unraveling -->The role of line-of-sight communication in the locations of megalythic structures, hilltop temples, and the construction of straight roads cleared of tree canopy for visual signaling.


<!--complimented by audio and high areal light displays (fireworks and reflection off clouds, tops of ziggurats and mountain peaks)-->

We're expanding on the LinearA translations of [Hiro Kuroda](hiro/) by adding related information on the Minoan mirror network that fostered trade in the Aegean Sea between Egypt, Greece and Turkey.

Linear A (1) evolved to be concise, using sounds from the start of words, and (2) efficient with minimum strokes like its use in Indus Valley script to its offspring Japanese hiragana. Translations using Japanese seem to reveal that the Phaistos Disc contains a mirror signal chant about the seasonal trade migration to Athens where families bound across long distances by marriages used mirrors to "punt light" between islands where Minoan ships designated with white hulls were pre-certified by the trade network and traveled free of tarrifs.

The third image above is a dual-mirror for sending Morse Code which was inspired by a theodolite survey crew in India who were returning messages to other crew members.

The box-mirror above was found in Israel in 2023 in the tomb of a woman traveling with Alexander's generals.

## Dive in, but take your mirrors!

The shape of the Minoan shield is perfect for carrying the two sides of your mirror box - for communicating from boat decks to hill temples. With the strings attached to your metal plates, you have a scale for weighing shipping goods (grains and spices) in the market. When sealed with your front metal plate, the shield becomes a floatation device which holds your paperwork and cipher ax-mirror.

The convex shape of the shield would also allow a drum beat to be narrow-cast in a single direction for greater security during troop movement. (Great observation Stephen Thompson!)

From the side of a small polished ax-mirror, an imprinted ciper helps young mirror operators learn to translate the signals that arrive like drum beats - and sometimes are drum beats or even fires burning is signal towers, lighthouses and the tops of pyramids. &nbsp;Large polished labrys could have been pivoted by adults to send signals greater distances - sometimes over 70 km on a clear day between hilltop peaks!

Sometimes the fire signals may have been fueled by naturally seeping hydrogen and methane, like the hydrogen wind that rushes out of a dry well in a Mali village. In 2023, the Mali village converted from buring the hydrogen for power to using a clean fuelcell to power their homes!
