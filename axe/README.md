## Arkalochori Axe as Mirror Cipher

Let's explore the Minoan use of their labrys as both axes and signaling mirrors. The 3-columns of characters on the Arkalochori Axe match some of the symbols on the Phaistos Disc, which are also used on pottery to indicate the type of shipping content. The axes may have been used to flash message to a steady beat, similar to drum signals. The axe characters could be a song or cipher conveying consonant-vowel combinations and numbers that function simlar to Roman numerals.

The young warriors of Crete learned a dance which echoed the turns of the laberinth. Could this have been simultaneous training for signal mirror operation? In otherwords, were they learning how to twist their mirrors to represent the sounds of syllables within the dance?

"The dance known as the geranos was a chthonic (underworld) maze dance, around a horned altar, in honor of a female divinity." [1946](https://www.jstor.org/stable/283449) - The author suggests the origin was Minoan, but more recent findings tie the bull to the origin of the Minotaur maze to the Upper Nile. Cultures around the world used mazes to stump attackers.

<h2>Heaven and Earth Columns - Hers and His Mirror Beats</h2>

Minoan temples were often owned and operated by married couples. Together, they used signaling with mirrors and drums to support trade routes across continents.  The Minoan signaling system seems to have used 3 main beats to invoke character in columns 1, 2 and 3 on the Arkalochori Axe, which was used to punt (relay) messeages between boats and land.

Greece would later coordinate with Rome using a 5 mirror system with a 5x5 cipher to convey the 24 letters of Latin.
</div>

A clue that the Arkalochori Axe might be a signal transmission cipher is the dots at the top of each column, and the 3-dot "shortcut" characters within two of the columns. The character's verticle position in the column can be conveyed by 1 to 5 shorter pulses (dots).

**Lattice for Mirror Messages** 
1 Beat - Priestess Column: Heavenly scale 1 to 6
2 Beats - Priest Column: Earthly scale from 7 to 12
3 Beats - Announcment Column: Numbers 13, 14 and 15

A translation of the 1625 BCE [Malia Stone](../hiro/#malia) by Hiro Kuroda found that rolling dice with two ones is considered a heavenly outcome.  "Dearest, you may now be a lifeless body, but you are a lucky one, as if you just got double ones, throwing dice. Do go to Heaven."  One imagines the less fortunate person might not be entitle to the Mount Ida funeral package, and would hence repeat the cycles of life by returning to the earth and being reincarned multiple times before making it to heaven - with a proverbial roll of the snake eye double ones.

Note the similaries between the 3 columns on the axe and the 3 sections from the Hagia Triada Sarcophagus below. The funerary functions of women and men occur in the first two sections. In the third section, there are 3-steps, a floral symbol, and a building which has a long line and a short line, like the number 15 on the Axe. The missing bottom of the floral symbol probably had 4 leaves to match the number 14 on the Axe cipher.

<a href="/LinearA/img/hagia-triada-sarcophagus.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/hagia-triada-sarcophagus.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:900px"></a>
Egyptian influenced funereal cult (1370-1320 BC) [Details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Triada_Sarcophagus) - On the left side of the arcophagus we see dual mirror-axes (labrys) on poles - used to redirect sun akin to bull horns. The birds sitting on the mirrors signify the use of the mirrors in delivering messages great distances, as the crow flies.

15-syllable lines are common for funeral lamentations in Crete. "There exist the well-known standard responses and verses, but also more spontaneous and improvised dirges composed at the moment by a sorrowing relative." [Source](https://www.destinationcrete.gr/culture/music-in-crete/)

The 15 syllables on the Arkalochori Axe could represent the core template for customizing a dirge for sacrifice in which the sounds match numbers.  There also appears to be a clusering of 3 sets of 5 characters if we read all lines from top to bottom.

The three columns could also be invoked by rolling dice (selecting organs from the animal sacrifices). A die game (get it, die game!) may have assisted young players in memorizing the associations for later use with mirrors and drums. The geranos dance that young people learned in ancient Crete may have taught them more advance consonant-vowel sequences by memorizing the order of turns in a maze created with tile patterns in courtyards.

<a href="/LinearA/img/axe-actual.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/axe-actual.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; float:right; margin-left:30px"></a>

**Column 1: Feminine**
The first column presents the heavenly role of priestess (feminine) by starting with the symbol of Mount Ida, the home of the Minoan mother goddess with hill temples. Mount Ida, the large central mountain on Crete, was covered with trees, hence the first 2 symbols I-DA stand for Heaven's Tree Branches.<br>

**Column 2: Masculine**
The second column could be invoked with two beats introduces a more agreessive rhythm. Hence the second column seems to be associated to the masculine underworld-oriented role of priests - working with earth and mining, warfare, sea travel, and preparing animal offerings during the ceremonies. Since women and men also switched roles, the two figures at the tops of the columns are portrayed as androgenous.

**Column 3: Commands, Requests, Enlightment**
The third column could use 3 repeating beats for special messages. The top of the column is number 13, which seems like a forceful command with three stong beats (which invokes 10 for King) and three faster beats. We'll call 13 the Command Beat, like knocking on a door.

The third column, invoked by 3 strong beats, translates to KO-RE-DA, a sign from the heavens ([Hiro](../hiro/)). Note that 3-beats represent 10, the character and number for King, later echoed in the 10 commandments as refuges from Egypt and Crete crossed the desert.

The beats for 13 are 10 followed by 3 short beats. <span style="font-size: 11px">▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄  &nbsp; ▄ ▄ ▄</span> &nbsp; This three beat pattern of long and short is similar to SOS <span class="small" style="font-size: 11px">▄ ▄ ▄ &nbsp; ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄ &nbsp; ▄ ▄ ▄</span> in Morse Code. 13 may convey that the shit is about to hit the fan in the form of weather or war. Hearing 13 over and over (as THREE three THREE three oscillating beats) would indeed be very forboding. The pattern for 15 seems more calming (3 beats followed by a single beat like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony---bom bom bom bommmmm).

Higher numbers might continue as a clockwise spiral which loops like a figure eight through the center. The shapes of the characters enfrorse this looping movement.

### Character Details

The faces at the top of the first two columns may have been painted white and brown to indicate the female and male focus of the first two columns. Since the faces are androgenous, the icons cover men performing in the roles of women (as we see one in the mural above) and women in the roles of the second column (middle of the mural). The first face on the axe seems to still contain a slight white pigment on the left 2/3 of the face. Maybe it never covered more than 2/3 of the face, encouraging men to pitch in.

The two verticle ellipses (...) likely indicate where custom choruses are added to include time-sensitive details in the circulating messages (which function like published obituaries). The second verticle ellipses has 2 lines at the top, which probably indicates a male chorus. Even today, ellipses continue to mean "more details here"...



"In Central and East Africa, drum patterns represent the stresses, syllable lengths and tone of the particular language. In tone languages, where syllables are associated with a certain tone, some words are distinguished only by their suprasegmental profile. Therefore, syllable drum languages can often transfer a message using the tonal phonemes alone.

In certain languages, the pitch of each syllable is uniquely determined in relation to adjacent syllables. In these cases, messages can be transmitted as rapid beats at the same speed as speech, as the rhythm and melody both match the equivalent spoken utterance." [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drums_in_communication)


<!--
As a signal device read in multiple directions, the starting corner could be flashed as follows:

1st direction (counter-clockwise from bottom right) is the consonant, invoked by 1-dot. Second direction is 

Perhaps a 3-second burst meant the 3rd character on the Phaistos Disc, which appears to have been mass produced for distribution using stamps mounted on a printing press like fonts. The stamps themselves may also have been delivered with discs to allow communities to label their vases as packages for shipments.

Digging into the connection to Japanese, we can look at the possible of using of 3-lines of haiku to encompass full messages using haiku's 5-7-5 syllable combinations.
 

-The mirror network was primarily managed by women as a means to conduct trade and collect fees.
<a href="/LinearA/img/obsidian-mirror.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/obsidian-mirror.jpg" style="width:300px">


Starting around 1400 BCE, when the Minoan mirror communication network flourished, the Oracles at Delphi were women. Around 400 BCE the Greeks created a 5x5 signal cipher for the Romans. Known as the Polybius Checkerboard. It required five mirrors or fires at each node. The nodes had to be closer together (10 km rather then 70 km). Subsequently, information control shifted from women in hill-temples to military personnel in the field. By 400 AD the signal women at Delphi were replaced by male priests. By then, the bull-horn mirror stands on rooftops were interpreted as a form of idol worship, rather than communication infrastructure from an ancient trade network.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

### **Timing of Beats**

Reflected light can be tricky to see if the burst is too short, so let's assume that each of the column indicator beats is a full second.  Within the columns, we'll use a half second pulse for the equivalent of a dot in Morse Code. 

Beat - Full second - Medium (Mother God Foundation) - Roll of two 1's on dice = 1
Dot - A quick flash - Half a second or less following a beat
Pause - One second between characters

King 10 Beat - 3 second beats = 10
Doom 3+3 Beat - 3 second beats (10) followed by 3 dots = 13
Order 3+4 Beat - For trade requests
Enlightened 3+long Beat - like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony---bom bom bom bommmmm
Long - 1.5 seconds bommmmm - For counting 5 10 15 20 = 5 
 (Example: A clock stricking 3 o'clock counts by 5 with an elongated bommmmm bommmmm bommmmm sound.)

Two Full Seconds = 7 (Father Earth God) - 2 full beats spanning 2 seconds
Three Beats toghter = 10 (King and the law - 10 commandments) - 3 strong beats over 3 seconds

To guarentee that we don't miss a note, the recipent could return to the message to us backwards. The backwards direction informs us that it is our original message being confirmed, and allows the recipient to confirm the end of a message if they arrived late for the beginning.

When a pictograph does not exist in the cipher, syllables are formed by consonant-vowel combinations. Syllables would always start with 1 to 3 full beats - but the beats could occur faster than a second to indicate the formation of a syllable.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

### **Consonants**

Currently we have the following from Hiro's translation:

I D M N P Z I S N T M T C R D

In Japanese, there are 9 consonants (K, S, T, N, H, M, Y, R, W).

To create 15 unique consonants, some of the consonants in the second column could take a masculine (underworld) form. Here are five possible changes to create unique consonants: #7 from I to Y, #9 from N to V, #11 from M to H, #12 from T to K, #15 from D to B.

I D M N P Z Y S V T H K C R B

Another option is to make Number 3 (Ma) into Ka. Ka is the word for Soul in Egptian and has a similar [head ornament](https://www.google.com/search?q=Egyptian+Ka) to #3.


### **Vowels**

If vowels are represented in this cipher, they could occur in several ways.

- In the first two columns as 5 or 6 vowel sounds.
- In the cluster of 5 characters at the top including Ko.
- From the center counter-clockwise ending with Ko.
- Repeating multiple times whereever DA or another A sound occurs.

A common vowel order is A-I-U-E-O for syllables like Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko.
あ /a/, い /i/, う /u/, え /e/, お /o/

An interesting clue suggesting that the vowel series might repeat is that the DA sound occurs in intervals of 6 at 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33.  Musical scales could continue clockwise after character 15, then cross through the center like a figure eight.  If starting with the feminine column, the first scale would likely be a more lofty and heavenly scale. From there we descend to deeper notes, and battle chants. 

Since the characters on the axe contain multiple A sounds in each repetition using Hiro's translation, to create a vowel cipher we'd need alternative sounds for some characters. Using our consonant changes above, the first two sets of syllables are currently:

MA-NA-PU-ZE-I-SA 
VA-TA-HA-TE-KO-RE

It may not be necessary to make any changes if we assume that each instance of a recurring vowel scale (starting with DA) automatically applies a different consonant using a widely known standard. 

Some consonant sounds are naturally deeper, so perhaps these reside in later scales in a repeating 6-vowel sequences.  Such a series of changing pitches is similar to the Solfege (Do Re Mi) used to teach Western music scales, which was made popular by the Sound of Music.

We could end up with something like the following:

3\. A-I-U-E-O
9\. Va-Vi-Vu-Ve-Vo
15\. Ba-Bi-Bu-Be-Bo
21\. Da-Di-Du-De-Do (2 position)
27\. Ta-Ti-Tu-Te-To (11 position)
33\. Ha-Hi-Hu-He-Ho (8 position)
39\. Ra-Ri-Ru-Re-Ro
45\. Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko
51\. Sa-Si-Su-Se-So

Modern Japanese does not contain the following syllables any more: YI, YE, WI, WU, WE. The only consonant that can stand alone in Japanese, and has its own symbol, is N.


**Four Beats**

A signal using 4 or more quicker beats might be reserved for dance steps used with the Phaistos Disc and mazes drawn on the stone courtyards. 4 could be used for directions, 4 seasons of the year, and/or the four sides of discs when read backwards and forwards. The spiral on the Phaistos Disc is divided into sets of 3, 6 and 12, so a burst of 4-4-6 dots might mean: Use the dance chant in the 4th season (Spring, side B counter-clockwise), and go to the 6th verse within spring.

A translation of the disc as 4 seasons resides at the bottom of the current page, extending the work of Hiro Kuroda to include details about mirror communication and the collection of shipping tarrifs for storage in caves.

The laws of government could be invoked by RE (character 14). RE contains both 10 for the king's commendments and 4 for the shape of a small box (for transport, like an ark).  Four full beats follow RE within character 15, so RE-DA (14 15) sounds like King's box from heaven. <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size: 11px">&nbsp; ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄  &nbsp; ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ &nbsp; ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄</span>

For laws and customs that applied to shipping and marriage, the 4 areas of law could be based on seasons of the year, and conveyed on the disc in a dance - which was taught as a right-of-passage using dance-steps in a maze in the palace courtyard. Imagine being a child dancing in Crete in 1400 BCE, and traveling to new lands using drum and mirror communication that spanned continents.

## Minoan Shield

A figure-8 shield kit may have contained the reflective axe blade, mirror-box and cipher. It may have been designed to float. The two metal sides of the mirror-box may have served as the base plates of a scale - for weighing trade goods. The scale is depicted in Minoan priestess illustrations. Note how the spiral background matches the spiral of the [Phaistos&nbsp;Disc](../).

<a href="/LinearA/img/shield-figure-8.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/shield-figure-8.jpg" style="height:200px;max-height:200px;margin-right:30px"></a><a href="/LinearA/img/shield-front.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/shield-front.jpg" style="height:200px;max-height:200px;margin-right:30px"></a><a href="/LinearA/img/shields-spiral-wall.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/shields-spiral-wall.jpg" style="height:200px;max-height:200px"></a>

The convex shape of the shield would also allow a drum beat signal to be narrow-cast in a single direction for greater security during troop movement. (Great observation Stephen Thompson!)

## Bull Leaping

### Bull-Leaping - From The Indus Valley To Syria, Egypt, And Crete

Before 1700 BCE, following the collapse of the Indus Valley, the Mitanni migrated to Turkey, Syria and Palestine. They brought with them a new species of horse, more suitable for the war-chariot, a new method for horse training, and a perfected form of the chariot. - [more](https://www.bibhudevmisra.com/2017/01/bull-leaping-did-it-spread-from-indus.html)

In south India, "an Ay girl would not marry the man who was afraid to face a bull fight. This shows that it was a custom in the cowherd community for young girls, until they were married, to select their own bulls from the common stall and to tend them. The bulls would then be let loose, and which ever young cowherd could successfully bring the beast under control in an open contest, was deemed the proper life-partner for the girl. Apparently, it was one of the ancient wedding customs of the Ayars. This custom also can be traced to their family deity Krsna, who curbed the fury of seven bulls coloured black, white and brown and married the girls who were tending them."

Phaistos Disc Side A - <a href="../img/phaistos/phaistos-disc-side-b.jpg">View Side B</a>

Hiro writes: The symbol QA（38）at the center of side A (Counter-clockwise), representing a flower, must be Athens, the point of departure when Theseus left for Crete. The lines depict the farewell scene between King Aegeus and Theseus. At the end are the words, RJU-JE-PA-QE-RI that translates as “So I must take leave, to return again,” and the word “return” nudges the reader to flip the Disc over to continue reading on side B.

After reading side B from the center to the rim, the words TI-TU-(KI)-HE-RI（disappeared into his chamber) are found at the end, and “disappeared” reminds the reader to flip the Disc over once again. 

There may have been 3-states conveyable by each beat: a full 1-second signal, a quick signal flash, and no signal. (The original Morse Code used patterns of dots with similar blank spaces to represent a few of the letters.)

There are [12 unique timeline beats in African music](https://youtu.be/8ypTYNGLr5A?si=YthHmWpffm8Z_gIG&t=218). With possible origins on the Upper Nile and North Africa, a reflector-and-scepter mirror system may have used a beat to  convey pulses representing the the consonant-vowel characters using on a cypher like the labrys axe-mirror.

Hiro Kuroda found that the disc can be read in both directions like, forming for 4 unique story sequences. Perhaps reversing phrases was a means to send back messages to confirm receipt and add more details.

## The Four Seasons of the Phaistos Disc

[Loren Heyns](../../earth/) has added brackets with mirror-network trade system info. Oracles coordinated from hilltops with Minoan sailers to manage trade routes by approved white-hull boats. They collected taxes for storage in caves (national treasuries), as depicted in Minoan murals. Inspired by [Sheppard Baird's Minoan Web of Mirrors and Scripts](https://www.minoanatlantis.com/Minoan_Mirror_Web.php)

Hiro Kuroda interprets as a sequel to the legend of Theseus, where Theseus has returned to Greece after killing the Minotaur in Crete. Loren Heyns adds seasonal trade travel and long-distance communication using mirrors. Loren has also added seasons for the four reading directions.

<br>

### Side A Clockwise - Summer Travel

How the lake shines and brilliantly reflects!
[The ocean reflects like the mirrors we use to communicate between ships and land.]

Now I enter the lake, 
With an oar for punting, to reach Hades.
[Hades would be toward the west and north, where the sun goes to die. The Greeks gates of the underworld were in canyon of the River Acheron, in Epirus, northwestern Greece. In addition to rowing, "punting" may refer to twisting mirror-axes back-and-forth to relay rhythmic verse in long-distance messages, similar to rowing to a drum beat.]

The father I am to meet is the King, so let me believe in our reunion.
[Traveling to the northern land of our ancesters - up the coasts toward Turkey and northern Greece.]

Oh, the lake is deep blue at the height of summer,
[This side of the disc is about summer, a beautiful time for ocean travel to the north.]

I sense that as I punt through the cave river for the underworld, and the lake moves out of sight.
[The sun has set, no more light for mirrors to punt the sun.]

Heave ho! Now this way, now that, the cave implores, to my great misery,   
[Now we must rely on sound to avoid the shore and to communicate.]

And the raft makes the cave resound. “Heave, ho,” brings back, “Ho, heave,” by a ruse on this lake.
[The echos are like the opening rhythms we send by drums at night, but directionality is difficult.]

The lake speaks. “Oh perhaps, by a ruse, on this lake,”
[Is that the sounds of drums across the water, or waves crashing, or an enemy. We send a common song to confirm we are using the same cipher.]

And the raft makes the cave resound. “Heave, ho,” brings back, “Ho, heave,” by a ruse, on this lake. 
[If you play the beat one direction, I'll play it back from the other direction to confirm I've heard it correctly.]

These echoes are like a play on words, so heave and ho!
[The disc is recited backwards and forwards, using drum beats and mirror flashes that represent both syllables words.]

“Go, quickly!”   What was that?   “Hey, Mister.”
[These are quick ways to send phrases: speed up the beat, please repeat, and Hi I'm here.]

I see!  The lake speaks.   “Oh, is that so?”
[More shorthand. The lake speaks means I'm transmitting to you from a boat.]
<br>

### Side B Clockwise - Fall Return Voyage

[Athens communicates back to Crete. The season is fall.]

The lake (of Athens) at high tide filled you with remorse, 
[When the harbor is deeper it reminded you it was time to travel back home on the deep sea.]

You despaired and flung yourself, what a depressing story! “That is the reason. Why allude to it now?
[You fell, like a leaf from a tree. It's time to leave your loved ones. You gotta make a living.]

Turn back!　Be on your way home.”
[Back into the soil. Time to go back home before winter arrives here in the north around Athens.]

You hate it, it is a terrible story and brings me down. 
[Goodby summer. "So long Marianne," as Leonard Cohen would later sing in Greece.]

“For the rest, (ascend the throne / find a queen) in Athens without delay!”
[Time to settle into a homestead for the upcoming winter if you decide to stay.]

I know, please be discreet when you speak.
[Don't let the enemy know the day I will be traveling south by sea.]

“Go, in haste! We will meet again, on a mutually congenial day.”  A reunion.
[See you again in the spring. I'll return with a ship full of trade goods.]

With great father, let me trust him, as he said, he would see me again, on a mutually congenial day.
[I'll come home again when the weather is warm again. Father knows best.]

And then this small dragon will pass away, find solace.
[My boat is headed south where the weather will be nice and sunny. I am the Little Dipper leaving the north star.]

“Trust in old father, now like a bending branch. I will see you again, on a mutually congenial day, 
[See you in the spring son. The branches are heavy and I will take this harvest with me to trade in the south.]

In the remotest of lands.
[From the far north to the distant south we migrate and trade.]

Now, outside the lake, I must stop here. That big dragon in the sky must be father! Father in person!
[After the sun sets, I see a large mirror signal from my father, reflected with his mirrors. The big dragon is the Big Dipper above my father's home in the north.]

Hiro writes: The last word in the story, at the center of Side B, is two pictograms, DI-TI, together they form a cartoon image of the Big Dipper (TI /) projected low across the night sky, close to the waves (DI), just as Theseus must have discovered as he came out of the cave. By searching through YouTube with words such as “sea cave, Greece,” one finds a strong resemblance in Diros Caves, in southern Peloponnesus, known for long winding tunnels to be explored by boat; in Kefalonia, Melissani Lake is inside a huge cave, where waters are turquoise blue in the summer, that produces loud echoes. A Mycenaean tomb has been discovered on the island, suggesting the lake was known from ancient times.

Hiro continues: Theseus, upon his return to Athens after slaying the Minotaur, finds out that his father Aegeus had taken his own life by throwing himself into the sea. This tragedy had occurred because Aegeus had mistakenly believed that Theseus had been killed. Aegeus had made Theseus promise that, should he successfully conquer the Minotaur, he should use a white sail on his way back to Athens, and a black sail if he was killed, as an early message to Aegeus. 
Theseus had met Ariadne, daughter of King Minos, in Crete and they became lovers. She helped him kill the Minotaur in the labyrinth and come back alive by giving him a ball of thread to guide his way back. Theseus intended to bring Ariadne back to Athens but had to leave her on Naxos at the behest of the deity Dionysus, who had fallen in love with her.
Theseus was so overcome with grief that he forgot to change the black sail to white on his final leg back to Athens. King Aegeus spotted Theseus’ ship from the Cape of Sounion and, catching sight of the black sail, threw himself into the sea from the cliff, in a fit of despair. The sea was thereafter called the Aegean.

[LHeyns adds: Defeating the Minotaur (jumping the bull) was a forerunner to marriage (right of passage) in cultures from the Mediterranean to India. Returning home to Athens in the spring without a successful marriage may have prevented a young captain from painting his boat white. Without a dowry from the bride's family, the young sailer may not have had funds to join the official Minoan white-boat trade network. It would be a gloomy day indeed for the future trading prospects between families. The defeated bull-jumper might as well not return home. Totally sucks, hence the term: total bullshit.]

### Side A Counter-clockwise - Winter Trade in the South

Hiro writes: The shape and design of the Phaistos disc, in which words are laid out in circular, whirlwind fashion, hints at a sense of playfulness and entertainment, whereby it can be read in both directions, clockwise or vice-versa, and make sense either way. This form of entertainment is known in Japan as kaibun, made possible by the syllabary nature of the language. Here, we shall reverse the word ordering on each side to see if the whole Phaistos Disc can be deciphered and still make sense.

Loren Heyns has added notations in brackets to include concepts based on mirror-network trading using white-hull boats, as depicted in Minoan murals.

I implore you, look, please hoist the white sail, I beg of you. 
Now listen. “What is that again?”  Look, this is a conspiracy with odds. 
[White boat hulls were paying members of the Minoan trade alliance, so they were not taxed or attacked.]

So now go.  A hunt, after all, is a wager. “Then it was thoughtless and stupid (to play this game).”
[You travel and trade at your own risk if you don't join our Minoan trade union.]

In these waters, promise me, OK?  “That’s no problem,” is your reply.
[Join the white boat hull network. It's good for you. These water could be Egypt, a winter destination.]

The promise is, to hoist a white sail once you enter the “lake” near Athens.
[Pay your membership fees when you travel in our Aegean Sea.]

In these waters, promise me, OK?  “That’s no problem,” is your reply.
[Okay, I will commit to tithe to the union and believe in the word of the hill temple oracles.]

Then, to top these words of commitment, let’s shake hands.
[Mirrors repeating a signal beat across hundreds of miles, like drums shaking hands.]

A handshake fills in for words, with clasped hands, twisted repeatedly. 
He wants me to believe in this odd enterprise.
[The handshake is the trade agreement sent with the beat of mirror-axes, twisting as they sent their product orders.]

It’s hard to hold back tears, with mutual stress, and I need to trust myself.
Now father, your walking stick/to Hades. I take leave but will return.
[It's winter, I'm away but I will be back with new trade goods once the weather changes.]

### Side B Counter-clockwise - Returning North during Spring Rains

(A) : Aegeus   (T) : Theseus

Father! We embrace and bring ourselves down in tears.
[It's spring, we connect with mirror signals! But the rain (tears) of spring are also here!]

Listen, we are bound to meet again, so no reason to be troubled today.
[The weather may be a barrier, but we will see you soon.]

Believe in me, Theseus, in the land of glory. Crying forever will not help,
As we are sure to meet again.
[It won't rain forever. You'll be able to travel home before you know it.]

(T)  I trust you, father. This will come true and there will be a reunion one day.
[See you soon! Damn this rain.]

Now as an excuse, bid farewell, Theseus!
[The skies are too dark to send mirror signals when the rain comes.]

(T) I already have said good…, now I leave Athens / but this does not add up.
[The mirror signal sent from Athens never comes back, because of the rainy weather.]

Look, (distancing himself)/ as victory is certain, this will end in bad taste.
[The distance is too great during bad spring weather to send signals for a clear trade order.]

(T) Theseus understands, said he, as if suffering from nausea.
[Communication breakdown, only small tremers (local signals) are heard. The seas are rough.]

Take leave now, all right?  You may jeer, but it will come true.
[Go ahead and proceed with a shipment, even though we have been unable to communicate, the weather will clear.]

He will never leave, so feeling, the late hours and without consolation,
Aegeus disappeared into his chamber. 
[The sun has set, still no signal received. Turn the disc and rejoice again on Side A.]

This is also a story of life, death and rebirth. Like the seasons, migrations carry our souls through the stories we send and how we receive them.

On one side appear to be the sun rising, bull horns, a path to follow that echos the shape of the island of crete, a sun setting, a signal fire and tall reflector, and directional signals.

The word written on the early disc might be Telchinia (Calchinia), the name of daughter of Leucippus (who only had a daughter). It may be very significant if women migrating to Create only had daughters. Early European men from Greece and eastern Europ had more Neaderthal genes and therefore may have only been able to conceive daughters with the wave of women from the Levant (Druze in Lebanon), who also formed settlements in Spain and Italy. We explore this DNA incompatibility further in [Diamond Storms](https://dreamstudio.com/seasons/winter/diamond-storms/). In the very least, the more isolated Eastern Europeans that migrated south into Greece may have initially been more susceptible to diseases that didn't effect the more urban populations arriving by boat.

Talos and Telchinia, writen in Semitic (Phoenician and Akkadian - Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic). Talos is the Sun, and the man of bronze, and Tauros. Zeus is called Talaios in Crete. As the protector, Talos made the circuit around Crete three times daily. We can infere this was a looping solar telegram process that transmitted in the morning, midday and before sunset via hill templs using the Minotar bull stands. Or maybe the labrys axe poles were pivoted in the hole within the disc above to aim at markers placed around the edges of temple courtyards to target a distant receiving station along the pathway drawn on side A.

Perhaps the older discs above where part of a system for steering mirrors on the bull horn mirror stands.

In Phoenician, the bull-head was called Aleph and later became the Roman letter A.

Corybantians were armored male dancers who kept time to a drum and the rhythmic stamping of their feet in a male coming-of-age initiation ritual. [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korybantes)

The dance steps they learned were based on short and long turns in a minotaur maze drawn on a courtyard and might provide us with further clues on how young people memorized LinearA consonant-vowel syllables for mirror and drum messages.
