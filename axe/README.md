# Figure-8 Shield and Mirror Axe

## Minoan Shield

The figure-8 shield case could provide storage for the reflective axe blade, mirror-box and cipher. Covered with protective cow hide, the satchel served as a purse and a covered tray for picnics. It may have also been designed to float. The mirror-box (above) would have fit within and served as the base plates for a scale to weigh trade goods. The convex shape of the shield would allow a drum beat signal to be narrow-cast in a single direction for privacy during troop movement. The spiral background matches the 2-way reading spiral of the Phaistos Disc maze dance song that encapulated signal transmissions.

## Arkalochori Axe as Mirror Cipher

<a href="../img/axe-actual.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/axe-actual.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; float:right; margin-left:30px"></a>

Let's explore the Minoan use of their large metal "labrys" as signaling mirrors. The 3-columns of characters on the Arkalochori Axe match some of the symbols on the Phaistos Disc, which are also used on pottery to indicate shipping products. The axes may have been used to flash message to a steady beat, similar to drum signals. The axe characters could be a song or cipher conveying consonant-vowel combinations and numbers that function simlar to Roman numerals.

The young warriors of Crete learned a dance which echoed the turns of the laberinth. Could this have been simultaneous training for signal mirror operation? In otherwords, were they learning how to twist their mirrors to represent the sounds of syllables within the dance?

"The dance known as the geranos was a chthonic (underworld) maze dance, around a horned altar, in honor of a female divinity." [1946](https://www.jstor.org/stable/283449) - The author suggests the origin was Minoan, but more recent findings tie the bull to the origin of the Minotaur maze to the Upper Nile. Cultures around the world used mazes to stump attackers.

In 1998 the video dance game [Dance Dance Revolution (DDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution) was released by the Japanese company Konami, who also created Frogger in 1981.

<h2>Heaven and Earth Columns - Hers and His Mirror Beats</h2>

Minoan temples were often owned and operated by married couples. Together, they used signaling with mirrors and drums to support trade routes across continents.  The Minoan signaling system seems to have used 3 main beats to invoke character in columns 1, 2 and 3 on the Arkalochori Axe, which was used to punt (relay) messeages between boats and land.

Greece would later coordinate with Rome using a 5 mirror system with a 5x5 cipher to convey the 24 letters of Latin.
</div>

A clue that the Arkalochori Axe might be a signal transmission cipher is the dots at the top of each column, and the 3-dot "shortcut" characters within two of the columns. The character's verticle position in the column can be conveyed by 1 to 5 shorter pulses (dots).

**Lattice for Mirror Messages** 
1 Beat - Priestess Column: Heavenly scale 1 to 6
2 Beats - Priest Column: Earthly scale from 7 to 12
3 Beats - Announcment Column: Numbers 13, 14 and 15

A translation of the 1625 BCE [Malia Stone](../hiro/#malia) by Hiro Kuroda found that rolling dice with two ones is considered a heavenly outcome.  "Dearest, you may now be a lifeless body, but you are a lucky one, as if you just got double ones, throwing dice. Do go to Heaven."  One imagines the less fortunate person might not be entitle to the Mount Ida funeral package, and would hence repeat the cycles of life by returning to the earth and being reincarned multiple times before making it to heaven - with a proverbial roll of the snake eye double ones.

Note the similaries between the 3 columns on the axe and the 3 sections from the Hagia Triada Sarcophagus below. The funerary functions of women and men occur in the first two sections. In the third section, there are 3-steps, a floral symbol, and a building which has a long line and a short line, like the number 15 on the Axe. The missing bottom of the floral symbol may have had 4 leaves to match the number 14 on the Axe cipher.

<a href="../img/hagia-triada-sarcophagus.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/hagia-triada-sarcophagus.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:900px"></a>
Egyptian influenced funereal cult (1370-1320 BC) [Details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Triada_Sarcophagus) - On the left side of the arcophagus we see dual mirror-axes (labrys) on poles. The birds sitting on the mirrors signify the use of the mirrors in delivering messages great distances, as the crow flies.

15-syllable lines are common for funeral lamentations in Crete. "There exist the well-known standard responses and verses, but also more spontaneous and improvised dirges composed at the moment by a sorrowing relative." [Source](https://www.destinationcrete.gr/culture/music-in-crete/)

The 15 syllables on the Arkalochori Axe could represent the core template for customizing a dirge for sacrifice in which the sounds match numbers.  There also appears to be a clusering of 3 sets of 5 characters if we read all lines from top to bottom.

The three columns could also be invoked by rolling dice (selecting organs from the animal sacrifices). A die game (get it, die game!) may have assisted young players in memorizing the associations for later use with mirrors and drums. The geranos dance that young people learned in ancient Crete may have taught them more advance consonant-vowel sequences by memorizing the order of turns in a maze created with tile patterns in courtyards.

<div style="clear:both"></div>


### **Column 1: Feminine**
The first column presents the heavenly role of priestess (feminine) by starting with the symbol of Mount Ida, the home of the Minoan mother goddess with hill temples. Mount Ida, the large central mountain on Crete, was covered with trees, hence the first 2 symbols I-DA stand for Heaven's Tree Branches.<br>

### **Column 2: Masculine**
The second column could be invoked with two beats introduces a more agreessive rhythm. Hence the second column seems to be associated to the masculine underworld-oriented role of priests - working with earth and mining, warfare, sea travel, and preparing animal offerings during the ceremonies. Since women and men also switched roles, the two figures at the tops of the columns are portrayed as androgenous.

### **Column 3: Commands, Requests, Enlightment**
The third column could use 3 repeating beats for special messages. The top of the column is number 13, which seems like a forceful command with three stong beats (which invokes 10 for King) and three faster beats. We'll call 13 the Command Beat, like knocking on a door.

The third column, invoked by 3 strong beats, translates to KO-RE-DA, a sign from the heavens ([Hiro](../hiro/)). Note that 3-beats represent 10, the character and number for King, later echoed in the 10 commandments as refuges from Egypt and Crete crossed the desert.

The beats for 13 are 10 followed by 3 short beats. <span style="font-size: 11px">▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄  &nbsp; ▄ ▄ ▄</span> &nbsp; This three beat pattern of long and short is similar to SOS <span class="small" style="font-size: 11px">▄ ▄ ▄ &nbsp; ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄ &nbsp; ▄ ▄ ▄</span> in Morse Code. 13 may convey that the shit is about to hit the fan in the form of weather or war. Hearing 13 over and over (as THREE three THREE three oscillating beats) would indeed be very forboding. The pattern for 15 seems more calming (3 beats followed by a single beat like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony---bom bom bom bommmmm).

Higher numbers might continue as a clockwise spiral which loops like a figure eight through the center. The shapes of the characters enfrorse this looping movement.

### Character Details

The faces at the top of the first two columns may have been painted white and brown to indicate the female and male focus of the first two columns. Since the faces are androgenous, the icons cover men performing in the roles of women (as we see one in the mural above) and women in the roles of the second column (middle of the mural). The first face on the axe seems to still contain a slight white pigment on the left 2/3 of the face. Maybe it never covered more than 2/3 of the face, encouraging men to pitch in.

The two verticle ellipses (...) likely indicate where custom choruses are added to include time-sensitive details in the circulating messages (which function like published obituaries). The second verticle ellipses has 2 lines at the top, which probably indicates a male chorus. Even today, ellipses continue to mean "more details here"...



"In Central and East Africa, drum patterns represent the stresses, syllable lengths and tone of the particular language. In tone languages, where syllables are associated with a certain tone, some words are distinguished only by their suprasegmental profile. Therefore, syllable drum languages can often transfer a message using the tonal phonemes alone.

In certain languages, the pitch of each syllable is uniquely determined in relation to adjacent syllables. In these cases, messages can be transmitted as rapid beats at the same speed as speech, as the rhythm and melody both match the equivalent spoken utterance."

As a signal device read in multiple directions, the starting corner could be flashed as follows:

1st direction (counter-clockwise from bottom right) is the consonant, invoked by 1-dot. Second direction is 

Perhaps a 3-second burst meant the 3rd character on the Phaistos Disc, which appears to have been mass produced for distribution using stamps mounted on a printing press like fonts. The stamps themselves may also have been delivered with discs to allow communities to label their vases as packages for shipments.

Digging into the connection to Japanese, we can look at the possible of using of 3-lines of haiku to encompass full messages using haiku's 5-7-5 syllable combinations.
 

-The mirror network was primarily managed by women as a means to conduct trade and collect fees.
<a href="/LinearA/img/obsidian-mirror.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/obsidian-mirror.jpg" style="width:300px">


Starting around 1400 BCE, when the Minoan mirror communication network flourished, the Oracles at Delphi were women. Around 400 BCE the Greeks created a 5x5 signal cipher for the Romans. Known as the Polybius Checkerboard. It required five mirrors or fires at each node. The nodes had to be closer together (10 km rather then 70 km). Subsequently, information control shifted from women in hill-temples to military personnel in the field. By 400 AD the signal women at Delphi were replaced by male priests. By then, the bull-horn mirror stands on rooftops were interpreted as a form of idol worship, rather than communication infrastructure from an ancient trade network.

### **Timing of Beats**

Reflected light can be tricky to see if the burst is too short, so let's assume that each of the column indicator beats is a full second.  Within the columns, we'll use a half second pulse for the equivalent of a dot in Morse Code. 

Beat - Full second - Medium (Mother God Foundation) - Roll of two 1's on dice = 1
Dot - A quick flash - Half a second or less following a beat
Pause - One second between characters

King 10 Beat - 3 second beats = 10
Doom 3+3 Beat - 3 second beats (10) followed by 3 dots = 13
Order 3+4 Beat - For trade requests
Enlightened 3+long Beat - like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony---bom bom bom bommmmm
Long - 1.5 seconds bommmmm - For counting 5 10 15 20 = 5 
 (Example: A clock stricking 3 o'clock counts by 5 with an elongated bommmmm bommmmm bommmmm sound.)

Two Full Seconds = 7 (Father Earth God) - 2 full beats spanning 2 seconds
Three Beats toghter = 10 (King and the law - 10 commandments) - 3 strong beats over 3 seconds

To guarentee that we don't miss a note, the recipent could return to the message to us backwards. The backwards direction informs us that it is our original message being confirmed, and allows the recipient to confirm the end of a message if they arrived late for the beginning.

When a pictograph does not exist in the cipher, syllables are formed by consonant-vowel combinations. Syllables would always start with 1 to 3 full beats - but the beats could occur faster than a second to indicate the formation of a syllable.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

### **Consonants**

Currently we have the following from Hiro's translation:

I D M N P Z I S N T M T C R D

In Japanese, there are 9 consonants (K, S, T, N, H, M, Y, R, W).

To create 15 unique consonants, some of the consonants in the second column could take a masculine (underworld) form. Here are five possible changes to create unique consonants: #7 from I to Y, #9 from N to V, #11 from M to H, #12 from T to K, #15 from D to B.

I D M N P Z Y S V T H K C R W

Another option is to make Number 3 (Ma) into Ka. Ka is the word for Soul in Egptian and has a similar [head ornament](https://www.google.com/search?q=Egyptian+Ka) to #3.


### **Vowels**

If vowels are represented in this cipher, they could occur in several ways.

- In the first two columns as 5 or 6 vowel sounds.
- In the cluster of 5 characters at the top including Ko.
- From the center counter-clockwise ending with Ko.
- Repeating multiple times whereever DA or another A sound occurs.

A common vowel order is A-I-U-E-O for syllables like Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko.
あ /a/, い /i/, う /u/, え /e/, お /o/

An interesting clue suggesting that the vowel series might repeat is that the DA sound occurs in intervals of 6 at 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33.  Musical scales could continue clockwise after character 15, then cross through the center like a figure eight.  If starting with the feminine column, the first scale would likely be a more lofty and heavenly scale. From there we descend to deeper notes, and battle chants. 

Since the characters on the axe contain multiple A sounds in each repetition using Hiro's translation, to create a vowel cipher we'd need alternative sounds for some characters. Using our consonant changes above, the first two sets of syllables are currently:

MA-NA-PU-ZE-I-SA 
VA-TA-HA-TE-KO-RE

It may not be necessary to make any changes if we assume that each instance of a recurring vowel scale (starting with DA) automatically applies a different consonant using a widely known standard. 

Some consonant sounds are naturally deeper, so perhaps these reside in later scales in a repeating 6-vowel sequences.  Such a series of changing pitches is similar to the Solfege (Do Re Mi) used to teach Western music scales, which was made popular by the Sound of Music.

We could end up with something like the following:

3\. A-I-U-E-O
9\. Va-Vi-Vu-Ve-Vo
15\. Ba-Bi-Bu-Be-Bo
21\. Da-Di-Du-De-Do (2 position)
27\. Ta-Ti-Tu-Te-To (11 position)
33\. Ha-Hi-Hu-He-Ho (8 position)
39\. Ra-Ri-Ru-Re-Ro
45\. Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko
51\. Sa-Si-Su-Se-So

Modern Japanese does not contain the following syllables any more: YI, YE, WI, WU, WE. The only consonant that can stand alone in Japanese, and has its own symbol, is N.


### **Four Quick Beats**

A signal using four (or more) quick beats might be reserved for dance steps used with the Phaistos Disc and mazes drawn on the stone courtyards. 4 could be used for directions, 4 seasons of the year, and/or the four sides of discs when read backwards and forwards. The spiral on the Phaistos Disc is divided into sets of 3, 6 and 12, so a burst of 4-4-6 dots might mean: Use the dance chant in the 4th season (Spring, side B counter-clockwise), and go to the 6th verse within spring.

## The Four Seasons of the Phaistos Disc

A translation of the disc as 4 seasons resides at the bottom of the current page, extending the work of Hiro Kuroda to include details about mirror communication and the collection of shipping tarrifs for storage in caves.

The laws of government could be invoked by RE (character 14). RE contains both 10 for the king's commendments and 4 for the shape of a small box (for transport, like an ark).  Four full beats follow RE within character 15, so RE-DA (14 15) sounds like King's box from heaven. <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size: 11px">&nbsp; ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄  &nbsp; ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ &nbsp; ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄</span>

For laws and customs that applied to shipping and marriage, the 4 areas of law could be based on seasons of the year, and conveyed on the disc in a dance - which was taught as a right-of-passage using dance-steps in a maze in the palace courtyard. Imagine being a child dancing in Crete in 1400 BCE, and traveling to new lands using drum and mirror communication that spanned continents.
