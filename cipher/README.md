### **Timing of Beats**

Reflected light can be tricky to see if the burst is too short, so let's assume that each of the column indicator beats is a full second.  Within the columns, we'll use a half second pulse for the equivalent of a dot in Morse Code. 

Beat - Full second - Medium (Mother God Foundation) - Roll of two 1's on dice = 1
Dot - A quick flash - Half a second or less following a beat
Pause - One second between characters

King 10 Beat - 3 second beats = 10
Doom 3+3 Beat - 3 second beats (10) followed by 3 dots = 13
Order 3+4 Beat - For trade requests
Enlightened 3+long Beat - like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony---bom bom bom bommmmm
Long - 1.5 seconds bommmmm - For counting 5 10 15 20 = 5 
 (Example: A clock stricking 3 o'clock counts by 5 with an elongated bommmmm bommmmm bommmmm sound.)

Two Full Seconds = 7 (Father Earth God) - 2 full beats spanning 2 seconds
Three Beats toghter = 10 (King and the law - 10 commandments) - 3 strong beats over 3 seconds

To guarentee that we don't miss a note, the recipent could return to the message to us backwards. The backwards direction informs us that it is our original message being confirmed, and allows the recipient to confirm the end of a message if they arrived late for the beginning.

When a pictograph does not exist in the cipher, syllables are formed by consonant-vowel combinations. Syllables would always start with 1 to 3 full beats - but the beats could occur faster than a second to indicate the formation of a syllable.

### **Consonants**

Currently we have the following from Hiro's translation:

I D M N P Z I S N T M T C R D

In Japanese, there are 9 consonants (K, S, T, N, H, M, Y, R, W).

To create 15 unique consonants, some of the consonants in the second column could take a masculine (underworld) form. Here are five possible changes to create unique consonants: #7 from I to Y, #9 from N to V, #11 from M to H, #12 from T to K, #15 from D to B.

I D M N P Z Y S V T H K C R W

Another option is to make Number 3 (Ma) into Ka. Ka is the word for Soul in Egptian and has a similar [head ornament](https://www.google.com/search?q=Egyptian+Ka) to #3.


### **Vowels**

If vowels are represented in this cipher, they could occur in several ways.

- In the first two columns as 5 or 6 vowel sounds.
- In the cluster of 5 characters at the top including Ko.
- From the center counter-clockwise ending with Ko.
- Repeating multiple times wherever DA or another A sound occurs.

A common vowel order is A-I-U-E-O for syllables like Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko.
あ /a/, い /i/, う /u/, え /e/, お /o/

An interesting clue suggesting that the vowel series might repeat is that the DA sound occurs in intervals of 6 at 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33.  Musical scales could continue clockwise after character 15, then cross through the center like a figure eight.  If starting with the feminine column, the first scale would likely be a more lofty and heavenly scale. From there we descend to deeper notes, and battle chants. 

Since the characters on the axe contain multiple A sounds in each repetition using Hiro's translation, to create a vowel cipher we'd need alternative sounds for some characters. Using our consonant changes above, the first two sets of syllables are currently:

MA-NA-PU-ZE-I-SA 
VA-TA-HA-TE-KO-RE

It may not be necessary to make any changes if we assume that each instance of a recurring vowel scale (starting with DA) automatically applies a different consonant using a widely known standard. 

Some consonant sounds are naturally deeper, so perhaps these reside in later scales in a repeating 6-vowel sequences.  Such a series of changing pitches is similar to the Solfege (Do Re Mi) used to teach Western music scales, which was made popular by the Sound of Music.

We could end up with something like the following:

3\. A-I-U-E-O
9\. Va-Vi-Vu-Ve-Vo
15\. Ba-Bi-Bu-Be-Bo
21\. Da-Di-Du-De-Do (2 position)
27\. Ta-Ti-Tu-Te-To (11 position)
33\. Ha-Hi-Hu-He-Ho (8 position)
39\. Ra-Ri-Ru-Re-Ro
45\. Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko
51\. Sa-Si-Su-Se-So

Modern Japanese does not contain the following syllables any more: YI, YE, WI, WU, WE. The only consonant that can stand alone in Japanese, and has its own symbol, is N.


### **Four Quick Beats**

A signal using four (or more) quick beats might be reserved for dance steps used with the Phaistos Disc and mazes drawn on the stone courtyards. 4 could be used for directions, 4 seasons of the year, and/or the four sides of discs when read backwards and forwards. The spiral on the Phaistos Disc is divided into sets of 3, 6 and 12, so a burst of 4-4-6 dots might mean: Use the dance chant in the 4th season (Spring, side B counter-clockwise), and go to the 6th verse within spring.

## The Four Seasons of the Phaistos Disc

A translation of the disc as 4 seasons resides at the bottom of the current page, extending the work of Hiro Kuroda to include details about mirror communication and the collection of shipping tarrifs for storage in caves.

The laws of government could be invoked by RE (character 14). RE contains both 10 for the king's commendments and 4 for the shape of a small box (for transport, like an ark).  Four full beats follow RE within character 15, so RE-DA (14 15) sounds like King's box from heaven. <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size: 11px">&nbsp; ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄  &nbsp; ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ &nbsp; ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄ ▄▄</span>

For laws and customs that applied to shipping and marriage, the 4 areas of law could be based on seasons of the year, and conveyed on the disc in a dance - which was taught as a right-of-passage using dance-steps in a maze in the palace courtyard. Imagine being a child dancing in Crete in 1400 BCE, and traveling to new lands using drum and mirror communication that spanned continents.
