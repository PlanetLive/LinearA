# The search for origins

Indus Valley Civilizaition may have traded with southeast Africa. The languages, like Japanese, may share open-syllable restriction in which most syllables end on a vowel or an n.

Similar sounds and Japanese words have been found in some South America tribes.  

Regions with high HTLV-1 prevalence may match migrations to South America from Africa and/or the Pacific AFTER the migration across across the Bering Strait around 10,000 BCE.  HTLV-1 is an ancient retrovirus that can cause leukemia. [Distribution maps](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/media/en/publications/Publications/geographical-distribution-areas-high-prevalence-HTLV1.pdf)

In HTLV-1 found in Andes mummumies from 500 AD but not populations of native North Americans suggests there were different waves of migration.  Today HTLV-1 is highest in western Sub-Saharan Africa, Iran, Romania (eastern Europe), Tiawan, southwestern Japan, Melanesia and the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Aboriginal Australians. 

India doesn't have a high prevalence for HTLV-1 (nor Greece). The Indus Valley Civilization reached it's peak from 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. The implication is that migrations of the language was not accompanied by the spread of HTLV-1, and that HTLV-1 spread to Japan more recently.

Indeed, the oldest evidence of HTLV-1 in Japan is from burial remains from around 500 AD during the Kofun period (approximately 3rd to 7th century AD). This suggests the relatively recent spread to Japan (and China) may have emerged from contact with older migrations from Africa via Aboriginal Australians and Pacific Island populations. Higher levels of Aboriginal genetics are also found in South America.

In the south of Peru and north of Chile, marine hunter-gatherers mummified everyone, 2000 years before Egyptians. Atacama was a thing from approximately 5450 BCE to 890 BCE.

## Figures of veneration and success

The figures seem to represent older women who have achieved status, leaders, honored matriarches, respecred grandmothers, the queen for the tribe. The elderly held elite status, performing rituals and making decisions that impacted the entire community. Fatness was a sign of social standing, age and seniority. "Fatness symbolized high status in a stratified society rather than an elevated place in a society of equals" - [Chris Kark](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2016/09/archaeologists-find-8000-year-old-goddess-figurine-central-turkey)

The Zambia Chichewa/Nyanja rules for vowel pronunciation, that are the exact same as the ones for Swahili and Japanese katakana.

Like Japanese, Swahili, Zulu, Xhosa, and Yoruba use syllables that tend to follow the pattern of a consonant followed by a vowel or a nasal consonant.

The most striking similarity is the open-syllable restriction, i.e. all syllables must end on a vowel or an n. For example, “Mitsubishi” must be hyphened “Mi-tsu-bi-shi”, since for example “Mit-sub-is-yi” would contain three non-Japanese syllables.

Many Niger-Congo languages have the same restriction. So this is found in East Africa also.

It is quite a clever innovation that allows people to speak fast as you don’t need to tempo to indicate which phonemes belong to which syllable. In English, for example, if you speak very fast you may confuse “push-up” with “poo-shop”. So it has been invented independently in many languages. Polynesian languages have it also.

You may wonder why there’s given an exception to the “n”. In Japanese, the answer is that it used to be strict vowel-final but then adopted a lot of Chinese loanwords that ended on consonants. Those ending on other consonants than n lost it to adapt to Japanese rules, but the n-final syllables were conserved as n is generally a strongly conserved phoneme (for example, that the word for “nose” contains an “n” is shared between an awful lot of languages).
