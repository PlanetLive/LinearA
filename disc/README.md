# The Seasons of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Disc

## A Story of Annual Trade&nbsp;Migrations between&nbsp;Families

by Loren Heyns, expanding on the [translation of Hiro&nbsp;Kuroda](../hiro)

"The shape and design of the Phaistos disc, in which words are laid out in circular, whirlwind fashion, hints at a sense of playfulness and entertainment, whereby it can be read in both directions, clockwise or vice-versa, and makes sense either way. This form of entertainment is known in Japan as kaibun, made possible by the syllabary nature of the language. Here, we shall reverse the word ordering on each side to see if the whole Phaistos Disc can be deciphered and still make sense." - Hiro

Oracles coordinated with Minoan sailers via reflected light from hilltop temples to manage trade routes by approved white-hull boats. They collected taxes for storage in caves (national treasuries), as depicted in Minoan murals. Inspired by [Sheppard Baird's Minoan Web of Mirrors](https://www.minoanatlantis.com/Minoan_Mirror_Web.php)

Expanding on Hiro Kuroda's interpretation of the disc story as a sequel to the legend of Theseus (where Theseus has returned to Greece after killing the Minotaur in Crete), Loren Heyns has adjusted the interpretation to include seasonal trade travel and long-distance communication using [mirrors and drums](https://dreamstudio.com/seasons/mirror-network/) - with interruptions by spring&nbsp;storms.


Starting clockwise, then flipping. Then reading both sides in reverse.  
(1) Summer to Athens, (2) Fall to Crete, (3) Winter Network Handshakes, and (4) Spring Return in Rain.

Part of the genius of the disc, and Minoan culture itself, is that the gender of the honored parent (the father and/or mother) is interchangable. As the Minoans traded with diverse cultures, the disc provided the flexibility to honor a mother Goddess AND a father God.  For our translation, we're honoring Hiro's focus on the northern fatherland, but note that Athens is a Goddess-oriented city. Most interpretations of the disc emphasize the Goddess - which may also be the sailor's young wife, as represented as the Big Dipper and child (the Little Dipper) that the sailer returns home to in the north.

By design, the disc story was crafted NOT to be succinctly interpreted. Instead, it supports unrestricted character roles and locations to allow the trade network to absorb diverse city-states as partners. The most consistent message is the importance of loyalty too the trade federation, with family bonds as the cohesive glue bringing sailors home between seasonal travel for&nbsp;trade.

# Summer Travel Northward

<div class="floatRight" style="margin-bottom:15px;max-width:500px;">
<a href="../img/phaistos/phaistos-disc-side-a.jpg"><img src="/LinearA/img/phaistos/phaistos-disc-side-a.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:3000px;border-radius:30px;"></a>

### (Side A Clockwise)

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Like the surface of the water my labrys mirror-axe (walking stick) reflects the sun. We punt light (between boats and land) to trade with the north and onward to Hades.<br><br>
I'm signalling to my relatives in Greece and Turkey.
Let's trust that we will be reunited in person soon.**</span>

"Punting" refers to trading with light by twisting the mirror-axes staff back-and-forth to relay rhythmic verse by passing signals between arrays of boats and hilltop temples.

Hades was the distant side of the mainland, where the sun goes to die. The Greek's "gates of the underworld" were in a canyon of the River Acheron, in Epirus in northwestern Greece. <!--Cape Tenaron at the southern tip of Peloponnesus is also mentioned by Hiro.-->

<!--
Hiro wrote: By searching through YouTube with words such as “sea cave, Greece,” one finds a strong resemblance in Diros Caves, in southern Peloponnesus, known for long winding tunnels to be explored by boat; in Kefalonia, Melissani Lake is inside a huge cave, where waters are turquoise blue in the summer, that produces loud echoes. A Mycenaean tomb has been discovered on the island, suggesting the lake was known from ancient times.

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Oh, the deep blue water at the height&nbsp;of&nbsp;summer!**</span>

We are midway in our crossing during our north-bound trade voyage.

Night has arrived and now we must rely on sound and the stars to navigate.

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Heave ho! Now this way, now that, the cave implores, to my great misery.**</span>

I'm crying (it's raining), we cannot see the stars, so we're unsure which way to go. 
Now we must rely on only sound to find our way.

KU-RJA-TE 　I-QE-(KO)-DA-TE　　 JE-(KO)-TU-TI　 I-QE-RA-NA-QA
くりゃて　　　いえ、こうだって　　　いえ、こっち　　　いけらなか

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**We hear our echo from the other side of the river (in the cave),<br>
as the sound of the raft makes the cave&nbsp;resound.<br>
“Heave, ho,” brings back “Ho, heave”.<br><br>
If the echo does not occur in reverse, we are not communicating.**</span>

These echoes are like a play on words (back and forth, like the kaibun phrases on the disc), so heave and ho!

The echoes are like the opening rhythms we send by drums at night to establish communication. But the reply must occur backwards (like the phrases on the disc), otherwise we are merely listening to natural echoes from the shore.

Sending back messages confirmed receipt and provided the recipient with an opportunity to add more details between surrounding phrases that were inverted kaibun-style.

# Fall Returning South&nbsp;to&nbsp;Crete

</div>

### (Side B Clockwise)

Athens communicates back to Crete. The season is Fall.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**At high tide in the pond (in Athens)<br>
I felt the soil myself.**</span>

It's time for our return south,  
the water in the port is at high tide.  
I stayed on land - we docked the boat&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;while.

I-QE-(MI)-TU-TI      　　KA-DI-TI-TE

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**I don't want to go&nbsp;to&nbsp;school.<br>
It's pathetic that he was left&nbsp;in&nbsp;despair.<br>
I have good reasons to travel.<br>
Why are you making fun of me?**</span>

If I stay for the Fall I will need to go to school.
The people that I leave behind will be sad, but I have a job to do.
Parting is difficult and may lead to intentional emotional distancing.

I-RAI- NA-YA /　(KI)-DWA-KA　 SAKA-E-NE-QE　SE-NA-RJU-TJA /

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Turn back!　Be on your way home.**</span>

Time to go back to your home in the south before winter.

PA-YE-RE-SA   SO-TI-PA-JE-RJU
かいぇれさ　　　　そちかえる
帰れ！　そちは帰るのだ」

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**I don't like (that I have to leave),<br>
it is a terrible story and brings&nbsp;me&nbsp;down.**</span>

Goodbye summer. "So long, Marianne," as Leonard Cohen would later sing&nbsp;in&nbsp;Greece.

きらいぜ　とは　　    ちえつて　　　いやにつ。

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**All that's left to do is quickly get the throne/queen in Athens!**</span>

Find your queen (northern wife) in Athens without delay!
Some will settle into a new homestead for the upcoming winter.

KA-DWA-QA-YE  AU-E-E-NE-TE　
あとは　早く　　アテネにて　王位/ 王妃　を得て！」

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**I know, please be discreet when&nbsp;you&nbsp;speak.**</span>

Please be careful with your words.

[Don't let the enemy know the day I will be traveling south by sea.]

SE-TA-RJU   AU-SA-JE　　　KE-TE-RA-RE-SA
知っている。  押さえ（て）　　語られさ。
知っています。言葉に気を付けて　話して下さい。

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Go, in haste! We'll meet again, on a mutually congenial day.**</span>  

The person you're meeting is... [fill in blank with trade destination]

See you again. I'll return with a boat full of trade goods.

I-PE-KA-JE  　　  AU-NI-TI-NO / 　　  　AU-NO-PA
いけはいぇ　　　　　あうにち－のちにあう　　あうのは
「行け、早く。　　　互いの合う日、後に会うから」　会う相手は

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Auchichi (breast milk) - Let's meet each other later.
I knew the day I met you, we'd meet again.**</span>

The sailor is making a commitment to return in nine months,

and when he does, it will likely be to a new born child.

AU-DI-TI /  　　　　(KI/MI)-AU-NI-TI-NO /   
あうちち－しじあう　きみ　あうにち　のちにあう　
偉大な父。信じよう、「君と合う日、後に会う」か。

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**At this time the small dragon (wooden boat) will travel away (scatter to heal).
Find solace (I&nbsp;will&nbsp;return).**</span>

Dragon boats were built in the north where trees were plentiful.

The northern families trusted that the young men they gave boats to would return.

KA-PI-NA-DWA 　　  　TI-RJU-TE
か　びな　　とは　　 　 散る/ちゆて。
その時、小さな辰/戸　は　散る/癒される　だろう。（注1）

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Trust me, my old father (now like a bending branch) will be happy.<br>I'll see you later (next year) on the same day of the year I met you.**</span>

This really is a love story.

The bending branch of the old father is heavy with fruit and I, the trusted son-in-law, will take the harvest with me to trade in the south.

TI-DI-TI /  　　TI-NA-RJU-E  (KI/MI)-AU-NI-TI-NO /  
信じて父を　　　しなるゆえ　　君と合う日、後に会う。　
「信じて、老父はしなるゆえ。君と合う日、後に会うから。

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**To the remotest of lands.
A land of destruction, far away.**</span>

From the far north we'll travel to the distant south to trade.

PE-QUI-RE-RJU-TI
きへきれる地。
遠く離れた所だ」

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**I left the water.  I must stop here.<br>
The big dipper (dragon boat) in the night sky (to the north) is the location of my father (and&nbsp;my&nbsp;goddess).**</span>

I've reached Crete or Africa. Looking back I see the big dipper in the north.

I-KE-TE-NA-TI 　 AU-PI-NA-DWA 　DI-TI /
いけてなし　　　　大きなとは     　　父、父！
池を出たが/これ以上は無理だ。夜空の大きな　辰/戸　は、父！　父に違いない！

<br>

At the center of side B, two pictograms (DI-TI) together form an image of the Big Dipper (TI) projected low across the night sky, close to the waves (DI).  This also relates to breast milk (DI-TI) of the pregnant and soon nursing goddess (new mother) motivating me to return north. 

After the sun sets, I see a large mirror signal from my father, punted across the Aegean with a series of mirrors, like the stars in a constellation pointed toward the North Star.


Hiro writes: Theseus, upon his return to Athens after slaying the Minotaur, finds out that his father Aegeus had taken his own life by throwing himself into the sea. This tragedy had occurred because Aegeus had mistakenly believed that Theseus had been killed. Aegeus had made Theseus promise that, should he successfully conquer the Minotaur, he should use a white sail on his way back to Athens, and a black sail if he was killed, as an early message to Aegeus. 

Theseus had met Ariadne, daughter of King Minos, in Crete and they became lovers. She helped him kill the Minotaur in the labyrinth and come back alive by giving him a ball of thread to guide his way back. Theseus intended to bring Ariadne back to Athens but had to leave her on Naxos at the behest of the deity Dionysus, who had fallen in love with her.
Theseus was so overcome with grief that he forgot to change the black sail to white on his final leg back to Athens. King Aegeus spotted Theseus’ ship from the Cape of Sounion and, catching sight of the black sail, threw himself into the sea from the cliff, in a fit of despair. The sea was thereafter called the Aegean.

Loren Heyns adds: Defeating the Minotaur (jumping the bull) was a forerunner to marriage (a right of passage) in cultures from the Mediterranean to India. Returning south without a successful marriage may have prevented a young captain from painting his boat white. Without a dowry from the bride's family, the young sailor may not have had funds to join the official Minoan white-boat trade network. It would be a gloomy day indeed for the future trading prospects between families. The defeated bull-jumper would probably not be able to afford a boat of his own.

# Winter Trade in the&nbsp;Far&nbsp;South

</div>

### (Side A Counter-clockwise)

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**I implore you. Please, raise your white sails.**</span>

Please participate in the trade network for your own safety.
When you return with a loaded ship, don't enter the waters around Crete as an undeclared (untaxed) merchant.

QA-U-ZO   JE-PA  SWI-RAI-TE-KA-KA-QUE-I 　QA-U-ZO
請うぞ　　　良いか　白い（帆）をかかげに 　　　　請うぞ
お願いするよ。良いか、　 白い帆を掲げてくれ、　　お願いだ。

<br>


<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**It's a gamble not to join the merchant network. Your odds are not good.**</span>

You're likely to be boarded and will pay a heavy tax (stored in caves) if you are an undeclaired dark-hull merchant sneaking through. You will likely be spotted from our hill temples located throughout the Aegean. White boat hulls were paying members of the Minoan trade alliance, so they were not taxed as heavily when boarded.

TE-DA-NA  　　 　　　JE-PA-QUE-NI　 QE-RYA-KU  
てだな-なだて　　　　　　いや、賭けに　　　計略　
それでだな「何ですって？」 いや、賭けのはかりごと

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Okay, go as you will. A hunt, after all, is a wager (gamble).<br>
(And you will simply pay a higher price if you are caught.)**</span>

In the end, you'll realize it was thoughtless and stupid to take the risks inherant in not joining the protective mirror trade network.

DA-(JU)-RJU-KE　KA-RJU-RA-TA/BA-KA-QUE-RI
だよ、行け。　　　結局、狩場は賭けだ/「（承諾は）軽率で馬鹿だった」
So now go.  A hunt, after all, is a wager. 

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**In these waters, promise me, OK?  “That’s no problem,” is your reply.**</span>

Make a vow to join the maritime network, ok?  
Sure, I'll pay the smaller tax voluntarily, rather than risk losing more of my goods.

RJA-KU-QE-I 　　　/JE-JO 　  RJU-NA-ZO-DWA-KA-I
やくけい－いけくりゃ　いぇよ－よいぇ　うな　そうだわかい
この海域に来たら、約束しろよ、良いな？「うん。そうだ」かい。

<br>


<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**My promise is that when in the Aegean (traveling to Athens), I will raise a white sail (white hull).**</span>

The white boats indicate we've paid our membership fees when traveling in the Aegean Sea.

RJA-KU-QUE-I 　   　NA-KASA  SWI-RAI-TE-KA-KA-QE-I
やくけい－いけくりゃ　　なかさ　　白い帆を掲げに

<a href="/LinearA/img/minoan-ships.webp"><img src="/LinearA/img/minoan-ships.webp" style="width:100%;max-width:3000px"></a>
The hulls of the boats in the network were painted white.

<br>


<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**So, as a pledge, in addition to saying our vows, let's shake hands.**</span>

The mirror handshake is the trade agreement sent with the beat of mirror-axes, twisting as they send their product orders.

TWE-RE  QA-NA-RA-QE-NI　TI-TU-(KO)-JE  TE-DA-(KO)-QE-I
では　　　 契りとして　　　（言葉）質の上に　手を合わせようかい。
それでは　 契りの言葉に加えて握手しようか。

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**A handshake is a word that comes back. Do you believe in betting?**</span>

Sailing is always a gamble. Mirrors repeating a signal across hundreds of miles, provide a means of virtually shaking hands to form a trade commitment without being together in person - an odd form of enterprise and human bonding indeed!

TE-RJA-KU   NE-RJU-KE-QE-RI　NO-(BEN)-KA　QE-TI-DI-KA
握手は、　　　くねり返す言葉だ。賭けを信じ、か。

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**It’s hard to hold back tears, with mutual stress, and I need to trust myself now father.**</span>

It will definitely make me cry, and it will make me feel bad for each other, so let's believe it. Oh, father

SA-TU-NWA-QE-RI　PI-AU-AU   　　/TI-DI-AU
さすがに泣ける　　　気負いあうので　信じよう－おお父
さすがに泣けるし　　気負いあうので　信じよう。おお、父


<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**From my homeland, I take leave but I'll&nbsp;return.**</span>

QE-TU-E           /RJU-JE-PA-QE-RI
へ　つ　え 　        ゆえ、帰り－いえ、帰る。
へ杖を/地獄へ。だから帰路に。いや、戻ります。

It's winter, I'm heading south, but I'll be back with new trade goods once the weather changes.

As Hiro observed, the word “return” nudges the reader to flip the Disc over to continue reading on side B.

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Listen (use drums), we are bound to meet again, so no reason to be troubled today.**</span>

Because of the spring rain, we can switch to relaying drum signals between boats and land.

The weather may be a barrier, but I will see you soon.

<br>

The storm is cutting off our communication between boats and land.

JE-WA-PE-NI　　SA-RE-RA-TE-KE
父： 言い訳に、　さらば 言っていけ/テーセウス！

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**No, goodbye... I said it. (Keep watching and listening for our signal)<br>

JE-SA-AU  　RJU-TA-SE   TE-NE-E-E-AU
テ：いえ、さよう……言ったぜ。 アテネ、出よう/ 足せてねえよう！(だけど計算が合わない！)

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Look! The distance is only: [insert the distancing remaining]<br>
so either a successful voyage is now certain!<br>
Or the other outcome: This will end in bad taste (we might not make it)**</span>

The signal sent from Athens may never come back due to bad weather.

JE-QA-DWA-KA  TU-NI-RJA-NI　    
父：いいか、と　分かつに/勝つに、厭になるから。

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Theseus understands, said he looked sick, as if suffering from nausea.**</span>

Only haphazard signals make it through the network. We're worried sick, unsure of the outcome.

You may be unsure of the outcome,<br>
but I'm optimistic everything will be alright.**</span>

Even though we have been unable to communicate, the storm will clear.

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">**Father/Mother Aegeus disappear into the room (the temple).**</span>

The spring dance performed at the hilltop temple has ended.  
We can only wait, and say a prayer that they will arrive safely in Athens.

The sun has set, still no signal received. Turn the disc to rejoice again on Side A - Summer time!

# A much earlier disc

Early discs from before 2200 BC - HINA

On one side appear to be the sun rising, bull horns, a path to follow that echoes the shape of the island of Crete, a sun setting, a signal fire and tall reflector, and directional signals.

The word written on the early disc might be Telchinia (Calchinia), the name of the daughter of Leucippus (who only had a daughter). Only having a daughter could be associted to the greater likelihood native European men would conceive daughters with the wave of women from the Levant (Druze in Lebanon), who also formed settlements in Spain and Italy. We explore this DNA incompatibility further in [Diamond Storms](https://dreamstudio.com/seasons/winter/diamond-storms/). The isolated Eastern Europeans that migrated south into Greece may have also been more susceptible to diseases from the urban populations arriving by&nbsp;boat.

Talos and Telchinia, written in Semitic (Phoenician and Akkadian - Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic). Talos is the Sun, and the man of bronze, and Tauros. Zeus is called Talaios in Crete. As the protector, Talos made the circuit around Crete three times daily. We can infer this was a looping solar telegram process that transmitted in the morning, mid-day and before sunset via hill temples using the route drawn on side A.

In Phoenician, the bull-head was called Aleph and later became the Roman letter A.

Corybantians were armored men who kept time to a drum and the rhythmic stamping of their feet in a male coming-of-age initiation ritual. [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korybantes)

The dance steps they learned were based on short and long turns in a minotaur maze drawn on a courtyard and might provide us with further clues on how young people memorized Linear A syllables for mirror and drum messages.

Turning back to 5260 BCE in the northern Aegean - [The Dispilio Tablet](https://jiroftscript.quora.com/Ever-heard-of-the-Dispilio-Tablet) is older than the pyramids and older than the Varna treasure, but not as old as Gobekli Tepe.

### The Minoans altered items from Egypt and shipped them to Greece
"Archaeological finds from Mycenaean sites such as Mycenae and Pylos indicate that the Minoans may have been working as intermediaries between the Mycenaeans and other cultures, such as Egypt, in their well-established trade networks. This theory has been addressed by Burns who commented: “not only was Minoan Crete a major source for prestige items in the Shaft Graves in Greece, but many of the materials and items imported from the eastern Mediterranean seem to have come through Minoan intermediaries”. This theory is corroborated through artefacts such as an ostrich egg, known from Egyptian craftsmen but found in a Mycenaean burial with Minoan embellishments, suggesting Minoan interference before its interment with a Mycenaean elite." - [WorldHistory.org](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1610/the-minoans--mycenaeans-comparison-of-two-bronze-a/)
